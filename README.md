# Climate Change VISUALIZATION
With growing concern around global warming, I wanted to explore how global land temperatures have shifted over time, especially by season. This project helps make climate trends easier to understand for the public using clean and interactive visuals.

My contributions:

Cleaned and transformed a historical global temperature dataset spanning over 250 years.

Created seasonal average plots (summer, winter, spring, autumn) to visualize changes across centuries.

Designed interactive line plots using Plotly to show rising global temperatures with tooltips for exploration.

Built a heatmap of average monthly temperatures across years to highlight seasonality patterns.

Developed a choropleth map to show global land temperature distribution by country and year.
